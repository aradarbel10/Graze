# Graze
Graze is a tiny low-level procedural language.
It is inspired mainly by C and Rust, but incorporates many lessons I've learned from functional languages.

Some prominent features are:
- Strong type system
- Product and sum types
- Pattern matching
- Type classes (single parameter)
- Manual memory management via first class regions
